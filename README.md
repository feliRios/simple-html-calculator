# Basic Web Calculator with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

In this project, I've created a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator features a graphic interface that displays buttons for numbers and basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input numbers and operations, and the calculator will show the result on the screen. This project has helped me improve my web programming skills and learn more about creating interactive applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
